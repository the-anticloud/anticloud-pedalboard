# PEDALBOARD

> `pedalboard` is a Python library for working with audio: reading, writing, rendering, adding effects, and more. It supports most popular audio file formats and a number of common audio effects out of the box, and also allows the use of [VST3®](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html) and [Audio Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units) formats for loading third-party software instruments and effects.

## What This Project Is

`pedalboard` is a Python library for working with audio: reading, writing, rendering, adding effects, and more. It supports most popular audio file formats and a number of common audio effects out of the box, and also allows the use of [VST3®](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html) and [Audio Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units) formats for loading third-party software instruments and effects.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

`pedalboard` is available via PyPI (via [Platform Wheels](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#platform-wheels)):
```
pip install pedalboard
```

If you are new to Python, follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) for a robust guide.

Recompute the hash above and compare — any drift means the package has been tampered with and the seal is invalid. This is a self-assessment; no external audit has been performed and a SOC 2 / NIST independent audit is committed post-funding.
